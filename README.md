# üìä Comprehensive Analysis and Dietary Strategies with Tableau  
*A College Food Choices Case Study*

## üí° Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship and focuses on the visualization and analysis of dietary habits, emotional triggers, and health-related behaviors among college students. Using **Tableau**, I transformed a complex dataset into interactive dashboards that provide real-time insights to guide student health, nutrition planning, and academic support.

## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Identify patterns and trends in students' food choices
- Understand the relationship between dietary habits and GPA
- Detect emotional triggers that lead to comfort eating
- Support institutions in making data-driven decisions for student wellness

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Academic Performance (GPA)
- Caloric Intake (daily and meal-wise)
- Breakfast habits
- Emotional Eating Triggers (e.g., stress, boredom)
- Comfort Food Preferences
- Physical Activity and Exercise
- Parental Background
- Ethnic and Cultural Food Preferences
- Self-perceived health and dietary changes

> Note: The raw dataset has been cleaned to remove nulls, standardize categorical values, and ensure consistency across numerical fields.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Summary

Key preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing/null values using mean/mode or tagging as unknown
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant entries
- Standardizing text-based fields (e.g., ‚ÄòIce Cream‚Äô vs ‚Äòice cream‚Äô)
- Converting string-based numeric values into proper data types
- Categorizing emotional and comfort food inputs for easier analysis

## üìä Dashboards Created

### 1. **Responsive Overview Dashboard**
- Global filters for gender, GPA, comfort food types, and more
- Interactive entry point for all subsequent analysis

### 2. **Dietary Habits and Preferences**
- Analysis of emotional eating patterns
- Visualizations of most common comfort foods
- Trends in meal frequency and eating speed

### 3. **Health and Nutrition Dashboard**
- GPA vs diet quality
- Fruit/vegetable intake vs perceived health
- Physical activity patterns and weight tracking

### 4. **Parental Influence and Eating Out**
- Parent education and profession vs diet behavior
- Eating out frequency by economic background
- Cultural/ethnic food preferences

## üîç Key Insights

- **Emotional eating** is most often triggered by stress and boredom.
- **High-calorie comfort foods** are correlated with lower self-perceived health.
- Students with **structured diets and regular exercise** routines tend to have **higher GPAs**.
- Parental education and socioeconomic status significantly influence food choices.
- Ethnic food preferences remain strong even after students enter college life.

## üß† Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** for dashboard design and data visualization  
- **Excel / Google Sheets** for data cleaning and formatting  
- **GitHub** for version control and project documentation
